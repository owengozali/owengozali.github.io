    <h1>Project 4 - Owen Gozali</h1>
    <h2>Photo Mosaics</h2>
    <h2>Part A: Manual Mosaics</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        In this project I will be stiching together imagestaken from the same center of projection, similar to constructing
        a panorama from scratch.
    </p>
    <h3>Part 1: Taking Images</h3>
    <p>
      I took a variety of images throughout the week leading up to this project. Here are the ones I ended up using:
    </p>

    
    <div class="image-container">
      <div class="image-item">
        <img src="images/house1.jpg" alt="Image 1">
        <p>View of house in northside Berkeley (I)</p>
    </div>
    <div class="image-item">
      <img src="images/house2.jpg" alt="Image 1">
      <p>View of house in northside Berkeley (II)</p>
  </div>
  <div class="image-item">
    <img src="images/imleft.jpg" alt="Image 1">
    <p>View of classroom while I was bored (I)</p>
</div>
<div class="image-item">
  <img src="images/imright.jpg" alt="Image 1">
  <p>View of classroom while I was bored (II)</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="image-container">
<div class="image-item">
  <img src="images/lab_left.jpg" alt="Image 1">
  <p>View of Berkeley Way West 8th Floor (I)</p>
</div>
<div class="image-item">
  <img src="images/lab_right.jpg" alt="Image 1">
  <p>View of Berkeley Way West 8th Floor (II)</p>
</div>
<div class="image-item">
  <img src="images/maxcap.jpg" alt="Image 1">
  <p>Picture of random sign</p>
</div>
<div class="image-item">
  <img src="images/bair.jpg" alt="Image 1">
  <p>Picture of random LCD display</p>
</div>
  </div>

  <h3>Part 2: Recovering Homographies</h3>
  <p>
    Similar to the previous project, we get correspondences between the images to be able to warp them to one another.
  </p>
    <div class="image-container">
      <div class="image-item">
          <img src="images/lab_corr1.png" alt="Image 1">
          <p>Point correspondences for first shot</p>
      </div>
      <div class="image-item">
        <img src="images/lab_corr2.png" alt="Image 1">
          <p>Point correspondences for second shot</p>
      </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    The problem is, we no longer can do a triangular warp to align the images, but need something more powerful: a homography.
    A homography is another type of imaging warping method but this has 8 degrees of freedom instead of one. The entire warp
    matrix can be configured except for the bottom right corner, which must be 1.

    We can derrive a more straightforward matrix of coefficients to solve using least squares:
  </p>
  <img class="small-image" src="images/math.png" alt="Image 1" width="50%">

  <p>
    Once we solve for our homography matrix, we can warp the image as we please.
  </p>

  <div class="image-container">
    <div class="image-item">
        <img src="images/lab_right.jpg" alt="Image 1">
        <p>Right shot of lab</p>
    </div>
    <div class="image-item">
      <img src="images/lab_right_warped.jpg" alt="Image 1">
        <p>Right shot of lab warped to align with left shot</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h3>Part 3: Rectifying Images</h3>
  <p>
    A neat thing we can do with our homographies is to rectify images. e.g. map square or rectangular surfaces into a flat
    projection. This can be done by calculating the homography using the surface's corners as the x, y and the flat 
    coordinates as the x', y' like [(0, 0), (0, 100), (100, 0), (100, 100)].
  </p>

  <p>Here are some examples of successful homographies.</p>

  <div class="image-container">
    <div class="image-item">
        <img src="images/bair.jpg" alt="Image 1">
        <p>Image of TV screen from an angle</p>
    </div>
    <div class="image-item">
      <img src="images/rectified_bair.jpg" alt="Image 1">
        <p>Rectified TV screen</p>
    </div>
    <div class="image-item">
      <img src="images/rectified_bair_cropped.jpg" alt="Image 1">
        <p>Cropped rectified TV screen</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="image-container">
    <div class="image-item">
        <img src="images/maxcap.jpg" alt="Image 1">
        <p>Image of sign from an angle</p>
    </div>
    <div class="image-item">
      <img src="images/rectified_max_cap.jpg" alt="Image 1">
        <p>Rectified signage</p>
    </div>
    <div class="image-item">
      <img src="images/rectified_max_cap_cropped.jpg" alt="Image 1">
        <p>Cropped rectified signage</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h3>Part 4: Blending Images into Mosaics</h3>
  <p>
    Using the homography and some clever alignment math, we can stich together images so they look like they're taken
    from the same perspective. I added an alpha chanel for the images to show where there is actually an image and when 
    is it just empty space to pad the image. I used the alpha chanels to blend the images together when they both head
    content.
  </p>


  <div class="image-container">
    <div class="image-item">
      <img src="images/house1.jpg" alt="Image 1">

    <h2>Part B: Autostitching</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      Manual stitching works fine, but we can streamline the process significantly by automating the correspondence annotation. 
      We can use some novel techniques to automatically detect features and calculate which ones match between images.
    </p>

  
    <h3>Detecting Corners</h3>
    <p>We can start by detecting corners using the Harris corner detector. We're interested in corners specifically
      because it's easier to see correspondences between images as they would look quite different when shifted
      in any direction. By using this corner detector, we can find many candidates for corners in the image.
      Let's try to do this on an imageo of an intersection near my house.
    </p>

    
    <div class="image-container">
      <div class="image-item">
        <img src="images/4b/bww/bww_l.jpg" alt="Image 1">
        <p>Left View</p>
    </div>
      <div class="image-item">
          <img src="images/4b/bww/bww_harris.png" alt="Image 1">
          <p>Left View with Harris Corners</p>
      </div>
      <div class="image-item">
        <img src="images/4b/bww/bww_r.jpg" alt="Image 1">
        <p>Right View</p>
    </div>
    <div class="image-item">
      <img src="images/4b/bww/bww_harris_2.png" alt="Image 1">
      <p>Right View with Harris Corners</p>
  </div>
  </div>

    <h3>Adaptive Non-Maximal Suppression</h3>
    <p>This is great for giving us a good amount of corner candidates, however it is much too dense to plug into
      our next steps in the model because we'll have to the magnitude of 3-4 thousand points. We typically only
      need 500 or so for the next step of the process so need a way to downsample these points.</p>

      <p>One straightforward method is to randomly sample but that could leave us with corner points with low
        "corner strength" values which was calculated from the Harris detector. We could also choose the top 500
        points with the highest corner strength, however that could lead to many points being focused on certain
        areas of the image which isn't desirable because we would want a good distribution of the throughout.
        A solution to this is to use Adaptive Non-Maximal Suppression which takes both distance and corner strength
        into account when trying to select an optimal subset of points. This is the result of running ANMS on our
        3k+ original corner candidates.
      </p>

      <div class="image-container">
        <div class="image-item">
            <img src="images/4b/bww/bww_harris.png" alt="Image 1">
            <p>Left View with Harris Corners</p>
        </div>
        <div class="image-item">
          <img src="images/4b/bww/bww_anms.png" alt="Image 1">
          <p>Harris Corners Narrowed Down with ANMS</p>
        </div>
        <div class="image-item">
          <img src="images/4b/bww/bww_harris_2.png" alt="Image 1">
          <p>Right View with Harris Corners</p>
        </div>
        <div class="image-item">
          <img src="images/4b/bww/bww_anms_2.png" alt="Image 1">
          <p>Harris Corners Narrowed Down with ANMS</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
      <h3>Feature Matching</h3>
      <p>Once we got a suitable set of corners, we now can start matching the points together between images to see
        which corners in image 1 correspond to which corners in image 2. The way we do this is by selecting a 40x40
        window around each point, apply gaussian blur to make it a smaller 8x8 window, and essentially find the two
        corners in the other image with an 8x8 window that looks the most similar. Then we discard the ones that arent
        significantly more similar to its closest neighbor compared to their second closest neighbor. Doing this
        ensures points that don't have a good match are eliminated as they probably are outside of the overlapping 
        range.
      </p>

      <p>Here is what it looks like when we apply this procedure to match up the points:</p>
      <div class="image-container">
        <div class="image-item">
          <img src="images/4b/bww/bww_anms.png" alt="Image 1">
          <p>Left Image Points</p>
        </div>
        <div class="image-item">
          <img src="images/4b/bww/bww_anms_2.png" alt="Image 1">
          <p>Right Image Points</p>
        </div>
        <div class="image-item">
          <img src="images/4b/bww/bww_nn_1.png" alt="Image 1">
          <p>Left Correspondences</p>
        </div>
        <div class="image-item">
          <img src="images/4b/bww/bww_nn_2.png" alt="Image 1">
          <p>Right Correspondences</p>
        </div>
    </div>

      <h3>RANSAC</h3>
      <p>However, there may still be some pesky little outliers remaining in our image. These would significantly
        affect the calculated homography because we calculate it using a least squares algorithm. Thus, we can
        eliminate these outliers through the following process: randomly subsample 4 points, use them to calculate
        a homography explicitly, then apply the homography to the remaining points and see if they are far off
        from the points they're supposed to be paired with, if they aren't label them as "inliers". Repeat this
        process a lot of times and find the homography with the largest number of inliers. This maximal set of
        inliers will be the final correspondences we can use to stitch together our homographies.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
          <div class="image-item">
            <img src="images/4b/bww/bww_nn_1.png" alt="Image 1">
            <p>Initial Left Correspondences</p>
          </div>
          <div class="image-item">
            <img src="images/4b/bww/bww_nn_2.png" alt="Image 1">
            <p>Initial Right Correspondences</p>
          </div>
          <div class="image-item">
            <img src="images/4b/bww/bww_ransac_1.png" alt="Image 1">
            <p>Left with Outliers Removed via RANSAC</p>

            <p>Right with Outliers Removed via RANSAC</p>
          </div>
      </div>
      <p>The rest of the procedure is identical to the manual case and we can generate some nice complex mosaics now
        without needing to manually add the points.</p>

    <h3>Takeaways</h3>
      <p>I think the biggest thing I learnt from this project is that I don't need to be worried about always
        implementing the most efficient solution from scratch. Sometimes it's better to get a basic version working
        and then iterating on it afterwards. I learnt this when doing the feature matching because I was stuck on
        designing a way to do the nearest neighbor searching efficiently without needing to gaussian blur it every
        time. Eventually I just implemented it and added caching with a dictionary and it worked just fine.
